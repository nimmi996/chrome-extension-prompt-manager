## 6. Narrative
Sarah, a marketing manager, opens ChatGPT to brainstorm campaign ideas for a new product launch. Instead of staring at the blank text box wondering how to phrase her request, she types `/=/` and instantly sees her organized prompt library. She searches "marketing campaign" and finds her proven template: "Act as a senior marketing strategist. Help me develop a comprehensive campaign for [PRODUCT] targeting [AUDIENCE]. Include key messaging, channels, and success metrics." One click later, the prompt populates with placeholders ready to customize. What used to take 5 minutes of thinking and typing now takes 10 seconds. Sarah spends her time refining her actual request instead of crafting the perfect prompt from scratch.
